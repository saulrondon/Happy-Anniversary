            <h2>Our history</h2>
            <p>Our story began in February 2022, when our lives first crossed paths. 
               From the very beginning, I felt a special connection with you mahal, 
               but fear of what my family would think and the distance between us made me pull away, I'm sorry. 
               Despite that, I couldn't stop thinking about you mi amor. We reconnected in July, but doubts still lingered. 
               It was in September when I realized I couldn't ignore my feelings for you, and I reached out again.  
               On October 10th, 2022, you asked me to give us another chance, and that's when our relationship began, 
               full of love and patience amor. From that moment on, we've faced challenges, but each one has made us stronger.
            </p>
            <p>In October 2023, after a year together in a long-distance relationship, 
               we decided to seal our commitment with rings that symbolize our promises and everything we've overcome my mahal. 
               Today, October 10th, 2024 mi amor, we celebrate two years of long-distance love, 
               a love that has defied the separation between the Philippines and Chile. 
               We've shared laughter, tears, and lessons, proving that no barrier can stop what we feel. 
               Despite the distance amor, we're closer than ever, and every day we reaffirm that our love is stronger than any obstacle.
            </p>
            <p>"From the first message until today amor, every day has been a new adventure. 
                Even though distance separates us, our love grows stronger with every video call, 
                message and promise of a future together".

        <h2>Our Memories</h2>
        <p class="descripcion">
            Our memories amor are much more than just photographs; 
            they are the living evidence of a love that has withstood the test of distance and time. 
            Each image tells a story of hope, of laughter shared through a screen, 
            of hugs that are yet to come, and of moments when mahal, despite being thousands of kilometers apart, 
            our hearts beat as one. Here lies the tale of two souls who mi amor, defying all barriers, 
            have managed to keep the flame of love alive.
            These photos not only capture fleeting moments mahal but also the dreams that keep us united 
            and the certainty that distance is merely a bridge to our reunion. 
            Each memory is a promise that the best is yet to come mi amor.

                    This video encapsulates more than just simple moments; 
                    it's a treasure chest of memories that transports us to the laughter, gazes, and songs that have shaped our story my mahal. 
                    Each image, carefully selected, represents a screenshot we've shared on days of joy and longing, 
                    like pieces of a love puzzle that we've built, piece by piece, across the distance. 
                    Accompanied by a special music, a melody that is very special to me amor, 
                    every second of this video comes to life to remind us how much we mean to each other.
                </p>
                <p class="texto-video">
                    As we move forward, we see ourselves reflected in photographs that speak without the need for words mahal, 
                    and though we are just two people in a vast world, our story shines like a beacon, 
                    lighting up the darkness of separation. 
                    Those memories that were once only digital take on meaning when woven into this video, 
                    becoming a story that needs no explanation, just love, mi amorcito.
                </p>
                <p class="texto-video">
                    Finally, the video takes us back to our first anniversary my mahal, 
                    a date that marked the beginning of a journey full of challenges, but also unforgettable triumphs. 
                    Through each captured moment, the promise is reaffirmed that, no matter how many kilometers come between us, 
                    we will always find our way back to each other. These memories, every time we look at them, 
                    remind us that what we share is eternal and, though we are apart, we are never truly alone.
